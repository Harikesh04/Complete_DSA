// for solving any dp problem  required things

// 1.state=> dp(a,b,c..) => a,b,c... these are parameter  required to solve any sub problem.
 

// 2.transition(recurrence relation)=> now try to link up nodes and build a recurrence to solve a sub problem using other nodes or dp state.

// (after thinking recurrence relation )

// 1.if top-down=> if we are solving our problem in the manner of larger to smaller than write recursive code and memoize it .simple

// 2.if bottom up => if we are solving smaller sub problem first than moving towards larger subproblem than solve problem itratively.

// 3.base case

// 4.final sub problem
